# Issue #18 Stream C: WebSocket Integration & Communication

## Core Tasks
- [x] Create MatchingNetworkHandler.cs - WebSocket integration layer
- [x] Create MatchingTimeout.cs - Timeout management system  
- [x] Create MatchingReconnection.cs - Reconnection logic
- [x] Integrate with existing WebSocket infrastructure
- [ ] Connect with MatchingManager from Stream A (awaiting Stream A completion)
- [ ] Test all components with comprehensive unit tests

## Analysis Phase (COMPLETED)
- [x] Read task requirements from 05-matching-ui-system.md
- [x] Verify WebSocket infrastructure from Issue #17 exists (WebSocketClient, NetworkManagerExtensions, HybridNetworkManager)
- [x] Check NetworkManagerExtensions for matching protocol support
- [x] Analyze MatchingProtocol for message handling
- [x] Read MatchingMessage, MatchingRequest, MatchingResponse data structures
- [x] Stream A dependencies: Will need to integrate with MatchingManager when available
- [x] Map integration points: WebSocket events → MatchingNetworkHandler → MatchingManager

## Implementation Phase (COMPLETED)
- [x] MatchingNetworkHandler: WebSocket communication layer ✅
- [x] MatchingTimeout: 60-second timeout with cancellation ✅
- [x] MatchingReconnection: Auto-reconnect with state recovery ✅
- [x] Integration with existing WebSocket infrastructure ✅
- [x] Error handling and user feedback systems ✅
- [ ] Integration with MatchingManager event system (pending Stream A completion)

## Testing Phase (PENDING)
- [ ] Unit tests for each component
- [ ] Integration tests with WebSocket infrastructure
- [ ] Mock server scenarios for timeout/reconnection
- [ ] Performance tests for 2-second response requirement

## Key Requirements
- 2-second response time target
- 60-second timeout for matching requests
- Auto-reconnection with state recovery
- Thread-safe operations with Unity main thread dispatching
- Integration with existing MatchingManager interfaces
