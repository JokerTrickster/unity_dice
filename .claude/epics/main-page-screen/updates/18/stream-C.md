# Stream C: WebSocket Integration & Communication

## Scope
WebSocket 통신 및 서버 연동

## Files
- Assets/Scripts/Network/MatchingNetworkHandler.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Systems/MatchingTimeout.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Systems/MatchingReconnection.cs

## Progress
- ✅ COMPLETED: Stream C implementation with comprehensive testing

## Deliverables
### Core Components Implemented
1. **MatchingNetworkHandler.cs**
   - WebSocket communication layer with complete integration
   - Event-driven architecture for MatchingManager integration
   - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback systems
   - Thread-safe operations with Unity main thread dispatching
   - Support for all matching request types (join queue, room create/join, cancel)
   - Heartbeat management and connection quality monitoring

2. **MatchingTimeout.cs** 
   - 60-second configurable timeout management system
   - Warning system (10-second warnings before timeout)
   - Multi-request tracking with player-based management
   - Timeout extension and cancellation capabilities
   - Statistics and monitoring (active timeouts, wait times)
   - Component lifecycle management

3. **MatchingReconnection.cs**
   - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - State recovery system for seamless reconnection
   - Application lifecycle integration (pause/resume, focus)
   - Configurable retry policies (max attempts, delays, backoff)
   - Connection quality assessment and monitoring
   - Thread-safe state management

### Test Suite (80+ Test Cases)
1. **MatchingNetworkHandlerTests** (35+ tests)
   - WebSocket initialization and connection scenarios
   - All matching request types and response processing
   - Message parsing, validation, and error handling
   - Heartbeat functionality and timeout integration
   - Connection state changes and quality monitoring

2. **MatchingTimeoutTests** (25+ tests)
   - Timeout lifecycle and multi-request management
   - Warning system and event handling validation
   - Statistics calculation and monitoring accuracy
   - Extension and cancellation edge cases
   - Component destruction and cleanup

3. **MatchingReconnectionTests** (20+ tests)
   - Reconnection state management and retry logic
   - Exponential backoff and configuration testing
   - State recovery and application lifecycle integration
   - Failure scenarios and maximum attempt handling
   - Component lifecycle and cleanup validation

### Integration Points Ready
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Full integration with Issue #17 components
- **MatchingManager Interface**: Event-driven integration ready for Stream A
- **NetworkManagerExtensions**: Seamless protocol compliance
- **Performance Optimized**: 2-second response time requirement support

## Technical Achievements
✅ Thread-safe operations with Unity main thread dispatching
✅ Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
✅ Comprehensive error handling and recovery
✅ Performance optimized for real-time requirements
✅ Extensive test coverage (80+ test cases)
✅ Mock infrastructure for reliable testing
✅ Component lifecycle management
✅ Configuration flexibility and extensibility

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
All Stream C objectives completed successfully. Ready for integration with Stream A/B components.
