## Scope
- Profile section UI implementation
- UserDataManager integration

- ProfileSectionUI.prefab

## Progress
- ✅ Created ProfileSection.cs - Main controller inheriting from SectionBase
- ✅ Refactored ProfileSectionUI.cs - Pure UI component managed by ProfileSection
- ✅ Extended UserData class - Added Title, AvatarUrl, Ranking properties
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive ProfileSection integration with UserDataManager
- ✅ Added profile statistics, achievements, and online status features
- ✅ Created ProfileSectionTests.cs - Comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ Implemented proper separation of concerns (Controller vs UI)
- ✅ Added event-driven communication between ProfileSection and UI
- ✅ Implemented offline mode handling and data synchronization

## Completed Features
- User avatar/profile picture display
- Username and level display
- Statistics (games played, win rate, ranking, play time)

- Profile customization options (edit profile, view achievements/stats)
- Online/offline status with visual indicators
- Experience bar with smooth animation
- Touch-friendly button sizing
- Proper error handling and logging
- Performance optimization with UI update throttling

## Testing
- Unit tests for ProfileSection controller logic

## Architecture
- ProfileSection (SectionBase) -> Controls business logic and data flow
- ProfileSectionUI (MonoBehaviour) -> Manages UI display and interactions
- Clean separation allows for easy testing and maintenance
- Event-driven communication for loose coupling
