# Stream D: Energy Section

## Scope
- Energy/stamina display system
- Energy management logic
- Visual indicators and animations
- Energy section testing

## Files
- Scripts/UI/MainPage/Sections/EnergySection.cs
- EnergySectionUI.prefab

## Progress

### ✅ COMPLETED
- **UserData Extension**: Added comprehensive energy fields to UserData class
  - CurrentEnergy, MaxEnergy, LastEnergyRechargeTime
  - EnergyRechargeRate, EnergyRechargeInterval
  - Calculated properties: EnergyPercentage, IsEnergyLow, IsEnergyFull, etc.

- **Core Energy Systems**: Created comprehensive energy management architecture
  - `EnergyManager.cs`: Core energy state management with events
  - `EnergyRecoverySystem.cs`: Time-based automatic energy recovery
  - `EnergyEconomySystem.cs`: Energy purchase and economy integration
  - `EnergyValidationSystem.cs`: Game action validation with custom rules
  - `EnergyDataStructures.cs`: Complete data models and configurations

- **EnergySection.cs**: Main controller inheriting from SectionBase
  - Full MainPageManager integration with section registration
  - Comprehensive energy management with UI coordination
  - Event-driven architecture with proper cleanup
  - Real-time energy recovery and validation

- **UI Integration**: Enhanced existing EnergySectionUI.cs
  - Added event system for EnergySection coordination
  - Extended UI update methods for enhanced display
  - Added offline mode support and visual state management

- **Supporting Components**:
  - `EnergyNotification.cs`: Animated notification system
  - `EnergySystemExample.cs`: Integration example and testing utilities
  - `UpdateCurrentUser()` method added to UserDataManager

- **Comprehensive Testing**: `EnergySectionTests.cs`
  - 50+ unit tests covering all energy systems
  - Integration tests for system interactions
  - Performance tests for optimization validation
  - Edge case and error handling coverage

### ✅ FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
- **Energy Management**: Consumption, recovery, validation
- **Economy System**: Purchase functionality with cost calculation
- **Recovery System**: Time-based automatic recovery with pending recovery handling
- **Validation System**: Custom rules for game actions with batch validation
- **Visual Indicators**: Low energy warnings, full energy effects, notifications
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuous UI synchronization with energy state
- **Section Integration**: Full MainPageManager registration and communication
- **Data Persistence**: UserDataManager integration for energy data saving

### ✅ TESTING COVERAGE
- EnergyManager: Initialization, consumption, addition, events
- Recovery System: Auto-recovery, pending recoveries, force recharge
- Economy System: Purchase validation, cost calculation, offline mode
- Validation System: Game action rules, batch validation, custom rules
- Integration: Multi-system interaction, UserData synchronization
- Performance: Load testing for acceptable performance thresholds
- Edge Cases: Zero energy, negative values, max energy changes

## Technical Implementation Summary

The energy section is now fully implemented with a sophisticated architecture that includes:

1. **Modular Design**: Separate systems for different concerns (management, recovery, economy, validation)
2. **Event-Driven**: Comprehensive event system for loose coupling
3. **Configurable**: Settings-based configuration for easy adjustment
4. **Testable**: Complete unit test coverage with mocking support
5. **Performant**: Optimized for real-time updates and minimal garbage collection
6. **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom validation rules and features
