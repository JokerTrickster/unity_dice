# Stream D: Integration & Testing

## Scope
시스템 통합 및 종합 테스트 - 방 시스템 통합 테스트, UI 테스트, 매칭 시스템과의 통합

## Files
- Assets/Scripts/Tests/RoomSystemTests.cs ✅ COMPLETED
- Assets/Scripts/Tests/RoomUITests.cs ✅ COMPLETED  
- Assets/Scripts/Integration/MatchingRoomIntegration.cs ✅ COMPLETED

## Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Integration Test Framework Setup (COMPLETED)
- Created comprehensive RoomSystemTests.cs with end-to-end integration testing
- Implemented performance monitoring and validation against acceptance criteria
- Setup test environment with proper lifecycle management
- Added performance tracking for 2초 응답시간 and 1초 상태 업데이트 requirements

### ✅ Phase 2: UI Integration Testing (COMPLETED)
- Created RoomUITests.cs with comprehensive UI workflow validation
- Implemented mock UI components for isolated testing (TestRoomCreateUI, TestRoomCodeInput, TestRoomPlayerList)
- Added UI responsiveness testing with frame rate monitoring
- Validated UI state transitions and error handling
- Memory usage validation for extended UI interactions

### ✅ Phase 3: System Integration Component (COMPLETED)
- Created MatchingRoomIntegration.cs as central coordination layer
- Implemented seamless integration between Room system and existing Matching system
- Added energy system validation and integration
- Created task queue system for coordinated operations
- Implemented performance monitoring and error handling

## Key Integration Tests Implemented

### End-to-End Room Flow Tests
- ✅ Complete room creation to game start workflow
- ✅ Multi-player join and synchronization
- ✅ Network disconnection and recovery scenarios
- ✅ Host privilege transfer testing
- ✅ Room expiration handling

### Performance Validation Tests
- ✅ Room creation response time (<2초) validation
- ✅ Player list sync time (<1초) validation  
- ✅ Memory usage monitoring (<5MB increase limit)
- ✅ UI responsiveness testing (>30 FPS maintenance)
- ✅ Extended operation performance tracking

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- ✅ Invalid room code handling with immediate feedback
- ✅ Energy insufficient scenarios
- ✅ Brute force protection testing
- ✅ Room capacity and expiration edge cases
- ✅ UI error display and user feedback validation

### System Integration Features
- ✅ Matching mode switching (Random ↔ Room)
- ✅ Energy system integration with validation
- ✅ Network state management and recovery
- ✅ Task queue system for coordinated operations
- ✅ Performance metrics collection and reporting
