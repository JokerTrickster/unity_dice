# Stream C: WebSocket Room Protocol Integration

## Scope
방 관련 WebSocket 통신 및 실시간 동기화

## Files
- Assets/Scripts/Network/RoomNetworkHandler.cs ✅
- Assets/Scripts/Network/RoomProtocolExtension.cs ✅
- Assets/Scripts/Systems/RoomStateSynchronizer.cs ✅

## Progress

### Completed (2025-09-02)

#### Phase 1: Protocol Extensions ✅
- **RoomProtocolExtension.cs**: Complete protocol extension for room functionality
  - Extended MatchingProtocol with 20+ room-specific message types  
  - Added comprehensive room data models (CreateRoomRequest, JoinRoomRequest, RoomResponse, RoomStateSyncData)
  - Implemented validation, serialization, and error handling
  - Created message factory methods for all room operations
  - Integrated with existing MatchingProtocol infrastructure

#### Phase 2: Network Handler ✅  
- **RoomNetworkHandler.cs**: Complete WebSocket room communication handler
  - Implemented all room operations (create, join, leave, game start, player ready)
  - Added performance tracking for 2초 응답 및 1초 상태 업데이트 requirements
  - Built comprehensive message routing and processing
  - Created timeout and reconnection management systems
  - Integrated with existing NetworkManager and WebSocket infrastructure

#### Phase 3: State Synchronizer ✅
- **RoomStateSynchronizer.cs**: Complete real-time state synchronization system
  - Implemented real-time room state synchronization with conflict resolution
  - Added performance monitoring and sync health checking
  - Built player state management with version tracking
  - Created comprehensive event handling for RoomManager integration
  - Added automatic sync recovery and error handling

### Architecture Integration
- All three components properly integrated with existing infrastructure
- Leverages WebSocketClient, NetworkManager, and MatchingProtocol
- Maintains compatibility with Stream A RoomManager
- Ready for Stream B UI integration

### Performance Features
- Request/response time tracking (target: 2초 응답)
- State sync performance monitoring (target: 1초 상태 업데이트)  
- Automatic timeout and retry mechanisms
- Connection quality monitoring and reconnection

### Key Integration Points
- Extends existing MatchingProtocol seamlessly
- Integrates with NetworkManager via extensions
- Connects with RoomManager through event system
- Thread-safe operations with Unity main thread dispatch

### Next Steps for Integration
- Integration testing with Stream A RoomManager
- End-to-end flow testing with UI components from Stream B
- Performance validation and optimization
- Error scenario testing and edge case handling
