# Stream C: Network Integration & HTTP API

## Scope
NetworkManager HTTP API 통합 및 서버 통신

## Files
- Assets/Scripts/Network/MailboxNetworkHandler.cs ✅
- Assets/Scripts/Systems/MailboxSynchronizer.cs ✅
- Assets/Scripts/Managers/MailboxManager.cs (extended) ✅

## Completed Work

### MailboxNetworkHandler.cs ✅
- **Complete NetworkManager Integration**: Fully reuses existing HTTP infrastructure
- **All Required API Endpoints**:
  - GET /api/mailbox/messages → Load messages with force refresh support
  - POST /api/mailbox/read → Mark message as read
  - DELETE /api/mailbox/messages/{id} → Delete message
  - POST /api/mailbox/claim → Claim energy gift with giftId support
- **Performance Optimized**: 3-second loading timeout, retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Robust Error Handling**: Network state validation, user-friendly error messages
- **Event System**: Complete event architecture for UI integration

### MailboxSynchronizer.cs ✅
- **Data Coordination**: Seamless integration between MailboxManager and NetworkHandler
- **Offline/Online Handling**: Queue offline actions, process on reconnection
- **Auto-Sync System**: 5-minute intervals with 1-minute retry on failure
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks sync times, warns if exceeding 3-second target
- **Timeout Management**: 10-second operation timeout with proper cleanup

### MailboxManager.cs Extensions ✅
- **SyncWithServerData()**: Process server data updates from synchronizer
- **ProcessClaimResult()**: Handle gift claiming with EnergyManager integration
- **Full Event Integration**: All events properly connected for UI updates

## Key Features Implemented

### Network Integration
- ✅ Complete NetworkManager HTTP method reuse (Get, Post, Delete)
- ✅ Proper JSON serialization/deserialization with MailboxData
- ✅ Authorization token handling through existing NetworkManager
- ✅ Network status monitoring and offline queue management

### Error Handling & Reliability
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- ✅ Network availability validation before requests
- ✅ Timeout handling with proper cleanup
- ✅ User-friendly error messages through event system

### Performance Optimization
- ✅ 3-second loading performance target with monitoring
- ✅ Efficient request queuing and cancellation
- ✅ Auto-sync with smart interval adjustment
- ✅ Memory-efficient offline action storage (max 100 actions)

### Integration Points
- ✅ MailboxManager event system fully connected
- ✅ EnergyManager integration for gift claiming
- ✅ NetworkManager status change handling
- ✅ Cache system integration through MailboxManager

## API Endpoint Implementation Status
- ✅ GET /api/mailbox/messages (with force refresh parameter)
- ✅ POST /api/mailbox/read (messageId)
- ✅ DELETE /api/mailbox/messages/{id} (messageId)  
- ✅ POST /api/mailbox/claim (messageId, optional giftId)

## Performance Metrics Achieved
- ✅ 3-second loading target with timeout monitoring
- ✅ Retry logic prevents permanent failures
- ✅ Efficient auto-sync reduces unnecessary requests
- ✅ Offline action queue prevents data loss

## Integration Testing Ready
- ✅ All components properly initialized through singleton pattern
- ✅ Event system fully connected for Stream B UI integration
- ✅ Error handling provides clear feedback for user experience
- ✅ Network state changes handled gracefully

## Stream C Completion Summary
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

All network integration requirements have been fully implemented:
- Complete HTTP API integration reusing existing NetworkManager
- Robust synchronization system with offline/online handling  
- Performance optimization meeting 3-second loading target
- Full error handling and user feedback system
- Ready for Stream B UI integration and testing
