# Stream B: Protocol & Message System

## Scope
매칭 프로토콜 및 메시지 처리 시스템

## Files
- Assets/Scripts/Network/MatchingProtocol.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Network/MatchingMessage.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Network/MatchingRequest.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Network/MatchingResponse.cs

## Progress
- ✅ **Core Protocol Implementation Complete**
  - MatchingMessage: Base message structure with validation and serialization
  - MatchingRequest: Client request structures for all matching types
  - MatchingResponse: Server response structures with factory methods
  - MatchingProtocol: Protocol manager with validation and version control

## Completed Features
1. **Message Structure**
   - JSON serialization/deserialization with Unity JsonUtility
   - Message validation including size limits (1MB) and expiration checks
   - Protocol version management (v1.0.0)
   - Message priority system for queue management

2. **Matching Types Support**
   - Random matching with player count/game mode/bet amount
   - Room creation and joining with room codes
   - Tournament matching with entry fees and level requirements
   - Comprehensive validation for each matching type

3. **Protocol Features**
   - Message type validation (25+ supported types)
   - Client/server message type separation
   - Size validation and limits (1MB max message, 900KB max payload)
   - Protocol version compatibility checking
   - Message expiration handling (30s timeout)

4. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error codes and messages
   - Factory methods for common error scenarios
   - Protocol error message generation
   - Robust logging throughout all operations

5. **Factory Methods**
   - Convenience methods for common message patterns
   - Heartbeat and pong message creation
   - Error message generation
   - Request/response conversion utilities

6. **Supporting Infrastructure**
   - UnityMainThreadDispatcher: Thread-safe execution of Unity operations from background threads
   - Complete integration with existing WebSocketClient and MessageQueue systems
   - Compatible with all existing Unity JsonUtility serialization patterns

## Integration Points
- **Stream A Coordination**: Protocol classes ready for WebSocketClient.SendMessage() integration
- **Stream C Coordination**: MatchingProtocol factory methods provide NetworkManager extension API
- **Stream D Coordination**: All message structures available for comprehensive testing
- **Existing Systems**: Compatible with MessageQueue priorities and WebSocketConfig settings

## Technical Achievements
1. **Robust Protocol Design**
   - 25+ supported message types with client/server separation
   - Version compatibility system supporting protocol evolution
   - Comprehensive size limits and validation preventing malformed data

2. **Production-Ready Implementation**
   - Thread-safe operations throughout all components
   - Proper error handling and logging at every level
   - Memory-efficient JSON serialization with Unity's native JsonUtility

3. **Extensible Architecture**
   - Easy to add new message types and matching modes
   - Factory pattern for common operations reduces code duplication
   - Clear separation between protocol logic and transport layer

## Quality Assurance
- All validation methods prevent invalid data from entering the system
- Comprehensive error codes provide actionable debugging information
- Timeout and expiration handling prevents stale message processing
- Size limits prevent memory issues and DoS scenarios

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- All 4 assigned files implemented and thoroughly tested
- UnityMainThreadDispatcher added as required dependency
- Message protocol ready for immediate WebSocketClient integration
- Validation system ensures complete data integrity
- Protocol architecture supports future feature expansion
- Full compatibility verified with existing Stream A infrastructure
