# Stream C: NetworkManager Integration

## Scope
기존 NetworkManager 확장 및 WebSocket 통합

## Files
- Assets/Scripts/Network/NetworkManager.cs (확장 - GetAuthToken 추가)
- Assets/Scripts/Network/NetworkManagerExtensions.cs (생성)
- Assets/Scripts/Network/HybridNetworkManager.cs (생성)
- Assets/Scripts/Network/WebSocketConfig.cs (생성)
- Assets/Scripts/Network/NetworkIntegrationExample.cs (생성)

## Completed Work

### Core Integration Components
✅ **WebSocketConfig.cs** - Comprehensive WebSocket configuration management
- Development/production mode presets
- Validation and error handling
- JSON serialization support
- Auto-reconnection and heartbeat settings

✅ **NetworkManagerExtensions.cs** - Extension methods for NetworkManager
- WebSocket initialization and connection management
- Message sending with priority support
- Matching protocol integration (join queue, create room, etc.)
- Event subscription helpers
- Optimal communication type selection

✅ **HybridNetworkManager.cs** - Unified HTTP + WebSocket manager
- Complete WebSocket client integration
- Message handling and protocol processing
- Connection quality monitoring
- Event forwarding and handler management
- Thread-safe operation with Unity main thread dispatching

### NetworkManager Enhancements
✅ **Added GetAuthToken() method** for WebSocket access
- Public API for authentication token retrieval
- Seamless token sharing between HTTP and WebSocket
- Maintains existing private field security

### Integration Features
✅ **Backward Compatibility** - All existing HTTP functionality preserved
✅ **Authentication Integration** - Shared tokens between HTTP and WebSocket
✅ **Protocol Integration** - Full MatchingProtocol support from Stream B
✅ **Client Integration** - Uses WebSocketClient from Stream A
✅ **Message Queuing** - Supports MessageQueue and ConnectionManager
✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error management and logging
✅ **Connection Management** - Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
✅ **Quality Monitoring** - Real-time connection quality assessment

### Usage Example
✅ **NetworkIntegrationExample.cs** - Comprehensive demonstration
- HTTP and WebSocket functionality working together
- Matching system integration
- Optimal communication selection
- Status monitoring and quality reporting
- Real-world usage patterns for Unity Dice

## Key Achievement
Successfully created a seamless hybrid network architecture that:
- Maintains 100% NetworkManager HTTP API compatibility
- Integrates WebSocket functionality without breaking changes  
- Provides unified access to both communication methods
- Supports real-time matching while preserving RESTful operations
- Demonstrates production-ready integration patterns

## Dependencies Satisfied
- Stream A: WebSocketClient, ConnectionManager, MessageQueue integration ✅
- Stream B: MatchingProtocol, MatchingMessage integration ✅
- Existing NetworkManager HTTP functionality preservation ✅

## Ready for Integration
The hybrid network system is ready for MainPageScreen integration with:
- Complete WebSocket matching support
- Preserved HTTP authentication and user management
- Unified error handling and logging
- Production-ready connection management
