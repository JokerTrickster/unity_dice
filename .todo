## Stream D: Integration & Testing
Status: COMPLETED ✅
Agent: Quality Engineer

### Core Tasks:
- [x] Create MatchingSystemTests.cs - End-to-end integration tests
- [x] Create MatchingUITests.cs - UI integration and performance tests  
- [x] Create EnergyMatchingIntegration.cs - Integration component for energy system
- [x] Validate all acceptance criteria through comprehensive testing
- [x] Test performance requirements (60FPS, 2-second response, <5MB memory)
